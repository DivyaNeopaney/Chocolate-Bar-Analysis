# Chocolate-Bar-Analysis
Project Summary:
The Chocolate Bar Ratings dataset from Kaggle features expert evaluations of over 1,700 plain dark chocolate bars, focusing on cacao flavor rather than health or ethical aspects. Along with ratings, it includes details like the regional origin,cocoa bean type, and bean source location. The ratings reflect a mix of objective and subjective factors, evaluating flavor, texture, aftermelt, and overall impression to capture the full tasting experience.
Key Attributes: 
- Company: The brand or producer of the chocolate (416 different producers).
- Bar Name: The label or variety of the chocolate bar, often based on bean origin (1,039 variations).
- REF: A distinct identification number for each bar.
- ReviewDate: The year the chocolate was evaluated.
- CocoaPercent: The amount of cocoa used, shown as a percentage.
- Location: The country where the chocolate was manufactured (60 total countries).
- Rating: A taste-based score ranging from 1.0 to 5.0.
- BeanType: The kind or blend of cacao beans used (41 listed types, with many entries left blank).
- BroadOrigin: The country where the cacao beans were sourced (100 different origins). 
Key Questions:
- What is the average chocolate bar rating by country?
- Which country produces the top 5 Beans?
- Which country produces the top 5 manufacure companies?
- What's the realtionship between chocolate rating and cocoa percentage?
Data Source:
- Type: External dataset
- Ownership: Created and published by Brady Brelinski, a co-founder of the Manhattan Chocolate Society, and hosted on Kaggle
- Source: Chocolate Bar Ratings on Kaggle
- Credibility: The dataset originates from a knowledgeable enthusiast group with expert reviews. While it's reliable for consumer product insights, it should be noted that it's community-driven, not official industry data.
Data Limitations
- Limited reuse rights: While the dataset is available for learning and research, using it for commercial purposes may require permission or rights confirmation.
- Incomplete bean type details: Around half of the entries for cocoa bean type are missing, which limits analysis based on specific varieties.
- Sampling Bias: Since most contributors are likely chocolate hobbyists or experts, the data may not reflect the preferences of the average consumer.
- Data coverage is outdated: The reviews stop at 2017, so the dataset doesnâ€™t reflect current products or recent market trends.
Ethical Considerations
- Privacy: The dataset contains no personal identifiers, so privacy risks are minimal.
- Representation: It reflects the tastes of a niche enthusiast community, which may limit its broader applicability.
- Transparency: Users should be aware that the data is subjective and community-based, and interpret findings accordingly.
