# Chocolate-Bar-Analysis
Project Summary:
The Chocolate Bar Ratings dataset from Kaggle features expert evaluations of over 1,700 plain dark chocolate bars, 
focusing on cacao flavor rather than health or ethical aspects. Along with ratings, it includes details like the regional origin,
cocoa bean type, and bean source location. The ratings reflect a mix of objective and subjective factors, evaluating flavor, 
texture, aftermelt, and overall impression to capture the full tasting experience.
